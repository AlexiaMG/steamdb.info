Steam Database
=============
Welcome to the GitHub page for [steamdb.info](http://steamdb.info/)! This repo hosts only the extension code, and serves as a public issue tracker. For the updater code and IRC bot see [here](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamDatabaseBackend).


### Intro
This tool was made to give better insight into the applications and packages that [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) has in its database. We go by **Steam Database**, or simply **SteamDB**, if you'd like. We are not affiliated with Valve in any way. Apps and packages in the database will update the second Steam sends out the update to the Steam client.


### FAQ and Contact
